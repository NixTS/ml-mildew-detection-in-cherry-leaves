Powdery Mildew Detector is a data science and machine learning project.  
The business goal of this project is to detect a biothrophic fungus infection called [Powdery Mildew](https://treefruit.wsu.edu/crop-protection/disease-management/cherry-powdery-mildew/#:~:text=Powdery%20mildew%20of%20sweet%20and,1) in cherry leaves by utilizing a convulutional neural network (CNN) trained on images sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/codeinstitute/cherry-leaves).

## **Dataset Contents**

The Dataset [cherry_leaves on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/codeinstitute/cherry-leaves) provided by [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/global) has been used in this project.

The dataset features 4208 photographs of cherry leaves and the images are already split 50/50 into healthy and powdery mildew infected cherry leaves. Each images shows a single leaf either infected or uninfected against a neutral background and consistent lightning.
